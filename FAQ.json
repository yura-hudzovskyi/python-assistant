Remove all indicators instances that you do not need at the current moment.\n\nFor example, you may have 2 MA on 2 timeframes (let's say on M5 and M15) of one chart.

To add a custom timeframe, please do the following:\n    1. Click the “Manage timeframes” icon (left to the “Pause” button).\n    2. Click “Add timeframe” to open the “Create timeframe” window.\n    3. Enter the necessary value in minutes and press OK.\n    4.

In our Basic (free) Subscription, we provide 1-minute historical data for the 18 most popular symbols from the Forexite broker (the data starts from 01.03.2001 and it is updated monthly). These medium-quality data are useful for long-term traders who prefer to backtest their strategies on daily timeframes and higher.\n\nDo you trade on timeframes from M1 to H4?\nIf you are an intraday trader and want to receive the most precise backtesting results, then please consider subscribing to the paid data services. Paid data subscriptions give you access to 800+ trading symbols including many cross-pairs, commodities, metals, and even stocks with indexes. These data are derived from different brokers and are updated on a daily basis.\n\nShould I choose a Standard or VIP subscription?\nIf you mostly trade on M1-H1 timeframes then you probably need to purchase tick data with floating spread (VIP subscription) – this will give you the most accurate testing results. If you trade on H2-H12 timeframes then you don’t need to bother yourself with tick data – Standard subscription will perfectly meet your needs.\n\nStandard and VIP data packages are paid monthly/annual subscriptions. Once the month/year is over, your credit card will be billed again for the same amount of money. You can cancel your subscription at any moment (just contact us at support@forextester.com)",

        "Notes": "When applying a template, it is important to note that it saves all indicators on all timeframes and all paint tools for a whole window. Indicators are attached to the timeframes but not to the whole chart, so when you see the indicators on different timeframes you actually see different instances of the indicator. If you attach your indicator to M5 timeframe you will not see it on M30 timeframe of the same chart. This was done with optimization purpose. Because it is very time consuming to recount all indicators when you change timeframe. So, that's why every indicator is linked to a specific timeframe to avoid extra calculations when you change timeframes. If you need, for example, this indicator on timeframe M5 and M15 then place 2 indicators on both timeframes. When applying a new indicator to the chart, you can choose the timeframes where to show, after that, several independent indicator instances are created and you cannot choose the timeframes again, only edit the settings of each instance separately.",

For example, how reach or poor would I be if I started trading with this strategy 10 years ago? \n\nIt is not wise to start trading live before you get solid results in backtesting.\n\nForex Tester is a specialized tool for backtesting. With Forex Tester you simulate trading in the past. Your charts will move just like they do in the live market, but the data will be coming from history and not from the live market. So you will get almost the same experience as you would get by trading live let's say in 2001 or 2021.\n\nBacktesting in Forex Tester has many advantages in comparison with testing your strategies on demo accounts because in Forex Tester you can:\n\n- Test any time period from history\n- Pause testing and continue later\n- Correct mistakes in manual testing (e.g. go back in time and cancel or restore a closed trade)\n- Control the testing speed\n- Test different (sets of) strategies in the same time period.\n- Test middle-term and long-term strategies much faster. With a demo account, it will take you forever to test your strategy because you will have to wait for the price to change. With Forex Tester you can speed up time and get the results much faster.\n- With Forex Tester you can test your strategy on different markers (different seasons, crises, news announcements, etc..). If you test your strategy only on a demo account, then there is a HUGE risk, that your results will be valid for one state of the market but completely invalid for other states of the market. So we strongly recommend testing your strategies on different parts of history (different states of the market).\n\nBy the way, wanna get more accurate backtesting results? Or do you crave to use high-quality historical data? You deserve all these must-have options, without which simulated trading takeoff is impossible.\n\nIf you are afraid that such “luxuries” are at a sky-high price, don’t worry, scaredy-cat. The cost of the data service depends on the subscription period and type.\n\nChoose the best one according to your needs and preferences.

In our Basic (free) Subscription, we provide 1-minute historical data for the 18 most popular symbols from the Forexite broker (the data starts from 01.03.2001 and it is updated monthly). These medium-quality data are useful for long-term traders who prefer to backtest their strategies on daily timeframes and higher.\n\nDo you trade on timeframes from M1 to H4?\nIf you are an intraday trader and want to receive the most precise backtesting results, then please consider subscribing to the paid data services. Paid data subscriptions give you access to 800+ trading symbols including many cross-pairs, commodities, metals, and even stocks with indexes. These data are derived from different brokers and are updated on a daily basis. \n\nShould I choose a Standard or VIP subscription?\nIf you mostly trade on M1-H1 timeframes then you probably need to purchase tick data with floating spread (VIP subscription) – this will give you the most accurate testing results.

In our Basic (free) Subscription, we provide 1-minute historical data for the 18 most popular symbols from the Forexite broker (the data starts from 01.03.2001 and it is updated monthly). These medium-quality data are useful for long-term traders who prefer to backtest their strategies on daily timeframes and higher.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Do you trade on timeframes from M1 to H4?</strong><br />\nIf you are an intraday trader and want to receive the most precise backtesting results, then please consider subscribing to the paid data services.

However, you cannot place orders and replay history in this mode. ",
        "Answer_original": "<p>Forex Tester has two working modes: History Mode and Testing Mode. The diagram below shows the relationships between these two modes:<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://forextester.com/templates/pic/WorkingModes/WorkingModes.png\" /></p>\n<p>You can switch between these two modes using this drop-down list:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://forextester.com/templates/pic/WorkingModes/ModeSwitcher.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> that each mode has its own desktop (the number of charts and their layout), and, when you switch between these modes, the chart layout will be changed according to the selected mode. Also, some options are available in one mode and not available in another. For example, the Start Test button is available in Testing Mode (because you can start testing only in this mode) and not available in History Mode. The same situation with Data Center. You can import/export/prepare historical data only in History Mode, so these buttons will be grayed in Testing Mode.<br />\n<strong>History Mode</strong>&nbsp;is designed for the next purposes:</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>It stores complete historical data for all currency symbols.</li>\n\t<li>In this mode, you can work with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forextester.com/topic?id=74\">Data Center</a>﻿, add or delete new currency pairs, adjust their settings.</li>\n\t<li>You can import/export historical quotes to/from the database. By default, after installation of the program, you have 14 major currency pairs already preset and one month of history for each of them imported. Such a small amount of history was included in installation for demo purposes and to make an installation package size not very large. You can download a complete history from our server through the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forextester.com/topic?id=74\">Data Center</a>&nbsp;from 01/01/2001 to the current moment after installation.</li>\n\t<li>The next important purpose of History Mode is to prepare data for Testing Mode. You can choose what symbol(s) from the database and for what period of time you want to test. For example, you want to test some strategy for EURUSD for period from 2004 to 2006. In this case, you need to prepare this data for Testing Mode by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forextester.com/ticks\">generating ticks</a>﻿&nbsp;for this currency for selected period of time.</li>\n\t<li>Lastly, you can use this mode as static to work with charts. You can not place orders and replay history in this mode, but all other functions - to draw on charts and to analyze history - are available.</li>\n</ol>\n---<br />\n---<br />\nBy the way, you can get more benefits with the new version of Forex Tester:<br />\n&mdash; As an owner of the old-version Forex Tester license, I want something special, okay?<br />\n<br />\n&mdash; You are heard.
